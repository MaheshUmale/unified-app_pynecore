## Architecture

- **Frontend**: SPA built with Tailwind CSS. Utilizes `lightweight-charts` for rendering and `Chart.js` for options analysis.
- **Backend**:
  - **Interface-Based Data Layer**: Decoupled ingestion layer using `ILiveStreamProvider`, `IOptionsDataProvider`, and `IHistoricalDataProvider` for multi-source redundancy.
  - `FastAPI`: Serves the UI and provides high-performance REST endpoints.
  - `Data Engine`: The central hub for processing raw ticks and routing updates.
  - `Confluence Engine`: A sophisticated signal generator in `brain/` utilizing `scipy` for technical level discovery.
  - `DuckDB`: Optimized columnar store for high-frequency tick and options history.

- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Set TradingView credentials or session cookies in `config.py` (or via environment variables) to access private indicators and higher-granularity data.

### Running the Server

Start the application from the project root:

```bash
python3 backend/api_server.py
```

- **Main Terminal**: `http://localhost:5051/`
- **Options Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5051/options`
- **DB Viewer**: `http://localhost:5051/db-viewer`

## User Guide

### 1. Multi-Chart Layouts
- **Switching Layouts**: Use the grid icons in the header to toggle between **1, 2, or 4 charts**.
- **Active Chart**: Click anywhere on a chart to make it "Active". The active chart is highlighted with a blue border.
- **Independent Controls**: Symbol search, timeframe selection, and indicator toggles apply only to the **currently active chart**. This allows you to monitor different symbols or timeframes side-by-side.

### 2. Symbol Search & Options
- **Discovery**: Type a symbol (e.g., `RELIANCE`) or index (e.g., `NIFTY`) in the search bar.
- **Options Discovery**: Searching for an index automatically fetches and displays associated option contracts from the TradingView Options Scanner.
- **Technical Symbols**: You can enter exact technical strings like `NSE:NIFTY260210C25600` for direct access to specific contracts.

### 3. Drawing Tools (HLINE)
- **Activation**: Click the **HLINE** button in the header (it will turn blue).
- **Placement**: Click anywhere on the active chart to place a horizontal price line.
- **Quick Shortcut**: Hold **Shift + Click** on the chart to place a horizontal line at any time, even if the HLINE tool is not toggled on.
- **Management**: Drawings are saved automatically and can be removed via the **Indicators** panel.

### 4. Indicator Management
- **Global Toggle**: Use **HIDE ALL / SHOW ALL** to quickly clear the chart of all indicator plots and markers.
- **Individual Control**: Click **INDICATORS** to open the management panel. From here, you can:
  - Toggle the visibility of specific indicator series (lines, areas, histograms).
  - **Customize Colors**: Change the color of any indicator or marker type (e.g., TRAPS) using the built-in color picker.
  - Toggles for markers and signals.
  - Remove individual drawings like horizontal lines.

### 5. Candle Replay
- **Enter Mode**: Click the **REPLAY** button.
- **Data Sync**: Upon entering Replay, the terminal fetches full historical options data for the day.
- **Select Start**: Click on any historical candle to set the starting point.
- **Controls**: Use **Play/Pause**, **Next**, and **Previous** to step through the price action.
- **Simulated Confluence**: As you step through candles, the **OI Profile** and **Analysis Sidebar** automatically update to show the nearest available historical OI/PCR/Scalper data for that specific point in time.
- **Exit**: Click **EXIT** to return to the real-time feed.

### 6. Confluence Tools
- **OI Profile**: Toggle this in the header to see the option chain distribution overlaid on your price chart. Red bars represent Call OI (resistance), and green bars represent Put OI (support).
- **Analysis Sidebar**: Toggle this to view a high-level summary of:
  - **OiGenie**: Detects whether buyers or sellers are in control and predicts potential sideways movement.
  - **OI Buildup Pulse**: Real-time census of Long/Short buildup and covering across all strikes.
  - **Scalper Pulse**: If the NSE Confluence Scalper is running, its live metrics and confluence dots will appear here.

### 7. Settings & Customization
- **Theme Management**: Use the **Moon/Sun** icon in the header to toggle between **Modern Dark Mode** and **High-Visibility Light Theme**.
- **Theming Logic**: The application uses a unified CSS variable engine (`--bg-main`, `--text-primary`, etc.) ensuring consistent colors across all charts, tables, and dashboards.
- **Typography**: Optimized for readability using the **Plus Jakarta Sans** font family, with distinct weights for data (600) and headers (800).
- **Layout Persistence**: Your layout configuration, selected symbols, timeframes, and drawings are automatically saved to `localStorage`. They will be restored exactly as you left them when you return to the application.

### 8. Changing Features & Config
- **Market Hours**: Most analysis tools default to Indian Standard Time (IST). Ensure your system clock is accurate for optimal real-time synchronization.
- **Data Intervals**: Toggle between 1M, 5M, 15M, and 1H intervals in the terminal header. Note that Options Snapshot data defaults to a 5-minute granularity.
- **DB Inspection**: Use the `/db-viewer` to run raw SQL queries if you need to extract custom datasets or verify snapshot integrity.

### 9. Advanced Configuration (backend/config.py)
Advanced users can tune the system by modifying `backend/config.py`:
- **Greeks Config**: Adjust the `risk_free_rate` (default 10%) or `default_volatility` for Black-Scholes calculations.
- **IV Thresholds**: Change `high_iv_threshold` (default 70) and `low_iv_threshold` (30) to customize IV Rank signals.
- **Snapshot Timing**: Modify `SNAPSHOT_CONFIG` to change the frequency of data collection (default is 180 seconds).
- **Symbol List**: Update `OPTIONS_UNDERLYINGS` to track additional indices or stocks in the Options Dashboard.

## Development & Customization

- **Indicator Mapping**: Indicator plots are mapped in `backend/static/app.js` using the `indicatorSeries` registry. Titles containing "Bubble", "Dot", or "TF" are automatically converted to chart markers.
- **Symbol Normalization**: Symbols are standardized using `backend/core/symbol_mapper.py` to ensure consistency between technical keys (e.g., `NSE:NIFTY`) and human-readable names (`NIFTY`).
